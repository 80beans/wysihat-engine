* get it working as a plugin again ( some problem with ResourceController )
* remove ResourceController, it's useless and confusing
* rewrite the :paste button to use josh's solution ( http://www.80beans.com/2009/10/01/wysihat-engine/comment-page-1/#comment-1834 )
* add sass versions of the stylesheets (and give an option to use those in the generator)
* add a minified and concatenated version of the javascript files (and give an option to use it in the generator)
* move more logic from the formbuilder to wysihat_engine.js
